# SirBearington
A discord bot for searching the Roll20 Compendium of 5E D&amp;D. Very much in progress. Needs a token to work properly.

Current supported commands:
"Ping!" returns "Pong!"
"/sb repeat" has Sir Bearington repeat what you say back to him in an amusing fashion"
"/sb search" has a rudimentary search of the Compendium (this is currently the biggest focus of the work!)
also dad jokes

If you want to set up Sir Bearington to work with your own bot, simply make a bot and have a .txt file with the bot's token in your My Documents folder (if that's inconvenient, you can hardcode it in, though obviously please do not submit pull requests with your token hardcoded in!)

Thanks,
StarFahx
